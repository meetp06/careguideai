### Installation

```bash
uv pip install airbyte-agent-incident-io
```

### OSS Mode

```python
from airbyte_agent_incident_io import IncidentIoConnector
from airbyte_agent_incident_io.models import IncidentIoAuthConfig

connector = IncidentIoConnector(
    auth_config=IncidentIoAuthConfig(
        api_key="<Your incident.io API key. Create one at https://app.incident.io/settings/api-keys>"
    )
)

@agent.tool_plain # assumes you're using Pydantic AI
@IncidentIoConnector.tool_utils(enable_hosted_mode_features=False)
async def incident_io_execute(entity: str, action: str, params: dict | None = None):
    try:
        return await connector.execute(entity, action, params or {})
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error: {type(e).__name__}: {e}"
```

### Hosted Mode

```python
from airbyte_agent_incident_io import IncidentIoConnector, AirbyteAuthConfig

connector = IncidentIoConnector(
    auth_config=AirbyteAuthConfig(
        customer_name="<your_customer_name>",
        organization_id="<your_organization_id>",  # Optional for multi-org clients
        airbyte_client_id="<your-client-id>",
        airbyte_client_secret="<your-client-secret>"
    )
)

@agent.tool_plain # assumes you're using Pydantic AI
@IncidentIoConnector.tool_utils
async def incident_io_execute(entity: str, action: str, params: dict | None = None):
    try:
        return await connector.execute(entity, action, params or {})
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error: {type(e).__name__}: {e}"
```
