# Orb

The Orb agent connector is a Python package that equips AI agents to interact with Orb through strongly typed, well-documented tools. It's ready to use directly in your Python app, in an agent framework, or exposed through an MCP.

**Key metadata:**

- **Package:** `airbyte-agent-orb` v0.1.52
- **Auth:** Token
- **Docs:** [Official API docs](https://docs.withorb.com/api-reference)
- **Status:** complete

## Example Prompts

- Show me all my customers in Orb
- List all active subscriptions
- What plans are available?
- Show me recent invoices
- Show me details for a recent customer
- What is the status of a recent subscription?
- Show me the pricing details for a plan
- Confirm the Stripe ID linked to a customer
- What is the payment provider ID for a customer?
- List all invoices for a specific customer
- List all subscriptions for customer XYZ
- Show all active subscriptions for a specific customer
- What subscriptions does customer \{external_customer_id\} have?
- Pull all invoices from the last month

from airbyte_agent_orb import OrbConnector
from airbyte_agent_orb.models import OrbAuthConfig

connector = OrbConnector(
    auth_config=OrbAuthConfig(
        api_key="<Your Orb API key>"
    )
)

@agent.tool_plain # assumes you're using Pydantic AI
@OrbConnector.tool_utils(enable_hosted_mode_features=False)
async def orb_execute(entity: str, action: str, params: dict | None = None):
    try:
        return await connector.execute(entity, action, params or {})
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error: {type(e).__name__}: {e}"
```

### Hosted Mode

```python
from airbyte_agent_orb import OrbConnector, AirbyteAuthConfig

connector = OrbConnector(
    auth_config=AirbyteAuthConfig(
        customer_name="<your_customer_name>",
        organization_id="<your_organization_id>",  # Optional for multi-org clients
        airbyte_client_id="<your-client-id>",
        airbyte_client_secret="<your-client-secret>"
    )
)

@agent.tool_plain # assumes you're using Pydantic AI
@OrbConnector.tool_utils
async def orb_execute(entity: str, action: str, params: dict | None = None):
    try:
        return await connector.execute(entity, action, params or {})
